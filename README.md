## What is NEAR Sandbox?

**NEAR Sandbox** is a lightweight interface for running and configuring a local NEAR blockchain node instance.  
It is designed for NEAR protocol contributors, integration testers, and application developers who need a reliable and programmable environment for testing interactions with the NEAR blockchain, with minimal dependencies.

NEAR Sandbox is essentially a [custom build](https://github.com/near/nearcore/blob/9f5e20b29f1a15a00fc50d6051b3b44bb6db60b6/Makefile#L67-L69) of the NEAR blockchain node (`neard` from [@near/nearcore](https://github.com/near/nearcore/tree/main/neard)), optimized for local development, testing, and automation. If you're familiar with [Ganache for Ethereum](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache), this is similar.
It provides an easy way to launch and control a local NEAR RPC endpoint, enabling the simulation and management of blockchain state for development and CI/CD workflows.
